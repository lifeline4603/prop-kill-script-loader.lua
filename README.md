# prop-kill-script-loader.lua
the loader for a stable and fully operational ttt propkill script

notes:
- this only works if you have access to the **oink api (oink.industries).** the functionality of this script relies completely on it
- theres a faq in the loader
- instructions are provided when you load the script
- the base script is obfuscated
- if this gets updated, you'll automatically have the update as long as you use the loader.
